            <p>I'm a composer and instrumentalist. I like weird instruments and play the otamatone. Follow me on Instagram for more content: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/evotamatone/">@evotamatone</a></p>

                <p>Wow I was a really edgy middle schooler. This is supposed to be a sad song with edgy lyrics except I don't know what the lyrics are anymore.</p>

                <h1>Piano Trio (2023)</h1>
                <p>This was my final for Intro Composition. I wrote it in like 4 days over Thanksgiving break. I tried experimenting with register and harmony to create this interesting gloom effect that serves as the undercurrent for the entire piece, and wanted to see how hard I could push my own sense of tonality to create new and interesting colors.</p>

                <h1>pain and suffering (2023)</h1>
                <p>This was my spring semester Fermata 24 composition! Every semester the Fermata Composers Collective at Brown holds an event where composers write a piece from 7pm-7am, and performers rehearse it until it gets performed at a concert at 7pm the next day (hence, 24). I wrote this in about 5 hours because they told me I was writing for solo trumpet and I had no idea what I was supposed to do so I came up with this monstrosity. Featuring impossible trumpet runs, variations on "Never Gonna Give You Up", "Cbat", and ending with a fun surprise (the lick)!! Enjoy!!!</p>
