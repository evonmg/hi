            <p id="intro"></p>

            <p>
                I'm broadly interested in studying human behavior computationally and modeling complex human systems with math. It means my transcript and experiences are kind of all over the place, but this has informed my interests in various areas of computer science (machine learning, natural language processing), social science (applied microeconomics/econometrics, linguistics, sociology, anthropology), and art (music theory), some of which I've explored and others I'm still getting to know better. However, I'm a big believer of learning for learning's sake, so I'm also interested in virtually anything outside of these areas as well! I also enjoy studying literature, music history, and various cool topics in the humanities and sciences.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm also a creator; I love the process of building things from scratch and messing around with them in my sandbox, whether it's music composition, fiction, or code (like this website!!), and savoring all the cool skills and knowledge I gain from this process. Recently I've picked up cooking, and the exploration that comes from throwing a bunch of random ingredients into a pot has become one of my favorite parts of my day. In my free time, I also enjoy learning and playing odd instruments, reading books (classics and fantasy/sci-fi) and Wikipedia, listening to music (late/post Romantic symphonies and piano pieces), and not finishing the main quest in open world video games.
